# 🌍 Floxi – Rewarding Green Choices, Empowering Eco Commerce

## 🌱 Inspiration  
We noticed a gap: many consumers want to make eco-friendly choices but **lack information and motivation**, and many businesses want to offer green alternatives but **struggle to reach the right audience**.  
Floxi was born to bridge this — by rewarding sustainable actions and enabling businesses to make data-driven green shifts.  

## 💡 The Problem & Opportunity  
- Consumers don’t know which products are truly eco-friendly.  
- Businesses often don’t know what non-sustainable products are being purchased.  
- There’s no unified platform that connects eco-conscious consumers with verified green products.

## 🛠️ What We Built  
**Floxi** is a **dual-platform mobile application** targeting both **B2C** and **B2B**:

### 👥 B2C: Empowering Individuals  
- 📸 **Eco Receipt Upload**: Users upload receipts of sustainable purchases.  
- 🏆 **Reward System**: Earn **EcoPoints** redeemable for **coupons** and **vouchers**.  
- 📦 **Barcode Scanner**: Instantly check a product’s eco-friendliness before purchase.  
- 📊 **Monthly Eco Report**: Visualize progress using **bar charts** and **eco wallets**.  
- 👤 **Profile & Wallet**: Track earned points, redeemed offers, and impact summary.  

### 🏢 B2B: Empowering Green Businesses  
- 🛍️ **Product Promotion**: Eco-friendly brands get featured to a target audience.  
- 📈 **Analytics Dashboard**: See what non-green items users are uploading and use that data to introduce sustainable alternatives.  
- 🎯 **Sponsored Rewards**: Offer incentives to users who choose their products.  
- 🌐 **Marketplace Visibility**: Expand reach within an environmentally aware audience.

### 🤖 AI-Powered by LLM  
- **Receipt Understanding**: We integrated **LLM (Large Language Models)** to intelligently extract and understand eco-related details from receipts, including item names, purchase details, and sustainability indicators.
- **Product Suggestions**: Using LLMs, Floxi can suggest eco-friendly product alternatives to users based on their purchase history and preferences.
- **Smart Guidance**: AI-driven prompts offer personalized suggestions for greener alternatives, making it easier for consumers to switch to sustainable choices.

## 🧱 How We Built It  
- **Flutter (Dart)** for cross-platform mobile UI  
- **Flask (Python)** backend hosted locally  
- **LLM Integration** for natural language processing on receipt data  
- **Barcode scanning**, **image uploading**, and **reward logic** fully integrated  
- Custom UI with **Concentric Circular Indicators**, **Eco Wallet Cards**, and **Monthly Bar Graphs**  
- Data structured to support both user interactions and business insights

## 📚 What We Learned  
- Importance of clean UI/UX in motivating user behavior  
- Structuring a business model that benefits both consumers and brands  
- Working with local Flask APIs and handling cross-device testing  
- Leveraging LLMs for actionable insights from data  
- How to design a scalable reward system backed by real-world actions

## ⚠️ Challenges  
- 🔄 Barcode integration and building a product eco-database  
- 📸 Optimizing receipt uploads for accuracy and size  
- 🔗 Connecting user actions to meaningful business insights  
- 🧠 Crafting a B2B+B2C system that feels unified, not fragmented  
- 🤖 Ensuring LLMs correctly interpret and offer valuable eco-alternatives from diverse receipt data

## 🚀 The Future of Floxi  
We envision Floxi evolving into a **green ecosystem platform** — where:  
- Users compete in eco-challenges, earn social badges, and build greener habits  
- Ecopoint as Token with Polygon Testnet initially then to Mainnet
- Businesses get real-time data on customer preferences and eco trends  
- Governments and NGOs can plug in to promote verified green initiatives
